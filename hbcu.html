            <p>
            Even though I've only been at my HBCU for a year, I can say I experienced a lot. Over the course of the fall and spring semester I made many friends and acquaintances, some I can see becoming lifelong friends. 
            </p>
            <p>
            While on campus I have become part of various clubs such as the Black Data Processing Association (where I hold the Treasurer Position) and the National Society of Black Engineers. I’m also part of my department’s Learning Living Community (LLC). In this program I was able to develop a close relationship with peers in a similar major as mine, I also participated in many events the program held such as movie nights. I attended many on campus events that I enjoyed like Set Friday, homecoming games and plays.             
            </p>
            <p>
                Attending Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University has also introduced me to the local Tallahassee scene. I’ve attended events such as First Friday held at the Railroad Square down the street from where my dorm is located. Here is where the community comes together to enjoy performances from local artists, explore various shops along the square and food trucks.
            </p>

                            I’m also a big “foodie” so during my time here on campus I made it my mission to explore and discover as many food pages as I can. I’ve come to fall in love with places such as the Iron Daisy that serves some of the best Tex-Mex food or Roboto that serves very good hibachi.
